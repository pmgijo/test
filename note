Business Summary:

Our business aims to address the pain points in the current income verification process by leveraging automation and advanced technologies. The process involves manual data input, opening and reviewing multiple PDF documents, manual calculations, and a heavy reliance on judgment to interpret information. This results in a slow and cumbersome process with increased time and effort for customers.

To overcome these challenges, we propose implementing an automated system powered by AI capabilities. By streamlining the income verification process, we aim to reduce the time taken to review, check, calculate, and verify income. This will minimize the reliance on judgment, leading to a more objective and efficient outcome. Additionally, the automation will improve turnaround time for customers, resulting in faster decisions and reducing the time and effort required for customers to calculate their income manually.

Reduction in the time taken to review, check, calculate, and verify income.
Decreased reliance on judgment and discretion in the income verification process.
Faster turnaround time for customers, leading to quicker decisions.
Reduced time and effort required for customers to calculate their income manually.
